# Pepper Portfolio - Web Project 

For my final project, I will be making a web portfolio for my dog, Pepper. This will be similar in structure to a dating/social media profile, including different pages for her likes, dislikes, friends, and favorite places, along with plenty of pictures of her with those things. The structure will be one page with links that scroll to different grids on the page, rather than multiple pages. 

The website can be found at: https://kaitlynmchugh.github.io/pepper-portfolio/ 

#

Baseline goals: 
Include at least 2-3 navigable html locations, scrolling to different parts on the page/profile, no dead ends
Include a sitewide css stylesheet 
Include images, with alt text
Credit all assets correctly 
Successfully display locally in a web browser (publish w github pages)
For all of the above, argue in the reflection why you did what you did – or what you would do if you had more time
Use meaningful commit messages that say what’s changing (or even why)

Aspirational criteria: 
Use many images, laid out in a clear pattern (e.g. grid)
Animate HTML elements via JavaScript (e.g. image carousel) 
Use Flexbox or Grid (or Float) layouts
