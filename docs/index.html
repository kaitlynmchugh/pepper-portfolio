  <h2>Best of Pepper</h2>
  <p> Pepper is maybe the most photogenic dog out there, so there's no shortage of fantastic photos of her. It was tough to narrow it down, but here's some of her best work: </p>

  <div id='likes'>
  <h2>Likes</h2>
  <p>What Pepper loves more than anything else comes down to one thing: sticks. If you take Pepper on a walk, she's gotta have a stick. You can try to use toys, treats, and your own charisma to get Pepper to come to you, but those who truly know Pepper can easily lure her in with a simple stick. Pepper is a fan of the simple things in life. She also likes the snow, doing big stretches, and sticking her head out of the car window. </p>

  <div id='dislikes'>
  <h2> Dislikes </h2>
  <p>Some of Pepper's least favorite things include packing, not being outside, and mirrors. If she sees you packing for a trip, you'll likely get a solemn stare and disappointed head nod as she leaves to to pack. She's not mad, just disappointed. As for going outside, Pepper is persistent. She will patiently wait by the door, maybe throwing in some adorable pawing at it, until she is happily running around her backyard, or sitting in her favorite spot on the deck. Maybe dislike is a strong word to describe Pepper's relation to mirrors, but she is definitely confused by them. She'll often stare at them intently wondering who is looking back at her. </p>

  <div id='friends'>
  <h2> Friends</h2>
  <p> Pepper is a very independent lady, and she can be a little shy around strangers, but once she gets to know you, she has no problem being friends.  </p>

<div id='places'>
  <h2> Favorite places </h2>
  <p> Pepper is a creature of habit. She is very accustomed to hanging out in the same few spots around the house. Inside, she loves to sit near windows, protecting the house from invaders. When she's feeling less bold, she'll hide in her lair, in a corner under a bench. Often, when she's feeling sleepy, she take a nap in her favorite spot on the couch, and rest her head on the arm. Outside, she loves to sit on the top of the stairs to the backyard, watching out for any suspicious activity. She's also not afraid to get into the thick of it, hiding incognito in bushes. </p>
